    <p>
        Large self-supervised (pre-trained) models (such as Large Language Models or LLMs) have transformed various
        data-driven fields, such as natural language
        processing (NLP).
        This advanced course aims to provide a holistic view of the issues related to these models.
        The class will mainly involve reading and discussing recent papers in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
        The focuses of this class will involve various issues regarding "scaling":
        data efficiency, model social, long context, multi-modality, reasoning grounded in web or physical world, security/legal/privacy issues.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Note:</b> The course is different from <a href="https://self-supervised.cs.jhu.edu/fa2022/">601.471/671</a>
        (offered in the spring semesters) which is focused on building the foundations for self-supervised models.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
        Natural Language Processing (CS 465/665), NLP: Self-Supervised Models (CS 471/671), or instructor consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Relevant Courses at Hopkins</strong>:
        This course has some overlap with "Natural Language Processing" (EN.601/665), and "Artificial Agents"
        (EN.601.470/670), though the courses have different focuses.

        <!--                Additionally, you get 2 sessions of presentation relief (i.e., you can skip 2 presentation assignments) to accommodate any deadlines you might have.-->
        <!--                If you decide to use these, make sure to email the instructor in advance (at least two days).-->
        <!--                Beyond that limit, you'd lose the attendance/presentation credits for any class you miss.-->
        <!--&lt;!&ndash;                If you miss a class without completing the corresponding assignment, you'll get a zero for that session.&ndash;&gt;-->
        <!--&lt;!&ndash;                Unfortunately you can't miss a class in which you're "presenting".&ndash;&gt;-->
        <!--&lt;!&ndash;                If you have to miss a class where you are in a "presenting" role for that session, you must find someone willing to swap presentations with (e.g., you were expected to present on Tuesday; but you swap presentations with someone who presents on Thursdays).&ndash;&gt;-->
        <!--&lt;!&ndash;                Alternatively, you must still create the presentation for that role before the class and you must find someone else to present it for you.&ndash;&gt;-->

        <!--&lt;!&ndash;                for the readings since it's vital that we're all reading the same papers at the same time.&ndash;&gt;-->
        <!--            </li>-->
        <li><b>COVID:</b> Students who report symptoms associated with COVID-19 are expected not to attend class and
            to isolate themselves for at least five days and until they have been symptom-free for 24 hours.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Course grade:</b>
            Your grade is based on the following activities:
            (1) one assignment (10%) -- done individually,
            (2) in-class participation (40%) -- done individually,
            (3) a final project (40%) -- done in groups.
            (4) attendance (10%) -- participation in class is our chance to
            learn more effectively.
            Up to 3% additional credit for any actions taken to improve the course that is brought to the instructors'
            attention.
        </li>
                <li><b>Late days:</b>
            Each student has 10 late days to use for assignments.
            A late day extends the deadline 24 hours.
            <!--            For final project reports that can be done in groups, teams can share late days between members.-->
            <!--            For example, a group of three people must have at least  six late  days between them to extend-->
            <!--            the deadline by two days. If any late days are being shared, this must be-->
            <!--            clearly marked at the beginning of the report. -->
            Once you have
            used all your late days, the penalty is 5% off the final homework grade for each additional late day.
            For example, if you're late for 3 days on an assignment (beyond your legitimate "late days" capacity, which
            is 7 days per
            homework and 10 days in total), you will lose 15% of the points for that assignment.
            The deadline cutoffs are at 12pm of each day. There are no fractional late days. If you're late for 1 hour,
            you lose a full day.
            <br>
            You can use up to 7 late days per assignment (so, if you're late on HW1, you can submit it until the release
            of HW2).
            <!--            (including homework assignments and project final  report). -->
            <!--            Once you run out of late days but submit late anyway, the submission will not award any points.-->
            <!--            Once you run out of late days but submit late anyway, the submission will not award any points.-->
            Assignments submitted after 7 late days will not be graded (unless explicit permission is given in advance
            by the instructor).
        </li>
        <li><b>Grading:</b>
            Homeworks are graded by the entire course staff, directly within Gradescope. To keep grading consistent,
            each numbered problem is graded by a single grader, under the supervision of one of the TAs, using a
            detailed
            rubric developed within Gradescope. Under normal circumstances, all homework should be graded within 10
            calendar days of submission.
        </li>
        <li><b>Regrading:</b>
            Regrade requests can be submitted directly within Gradescope and must include a brief written justification
            for the request.
            We encourage students who have questions or concerns about their grades to talk with the course staff before
            submitting a regrade request.
            However, no grades will be changed in any student's presence.

    <p>
        The objective of the final project is to make use of what you have learned during this course
        to solve a hard problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final project milestones include:
        (1) A project proposal,
        (2) A project midway report,
        (3) progress update presentation,
        (4) a final report,
        (5) a final project poster summarizing the technical aspects of the project.
        See the course calendar for the due dates.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Topic:</b> The topic of this project is open-ended.
            This project, for example, can focus on demonstrating systemic limitations of prior work
            or suggesting improvements on methods or benchmarks discussed in the class.
            <!--        reproducing one or more papers covered in the class (or relevant works)-->
            <!--        or extending them.-->
        <li><b>Group work:</b> Students are encouraged to work in groups on the final project (team sizes limited to
            2 or 3 people).
        </li>
        <li><b>Project proposals:</b> All groups will be required to submit a project proposal (due on the class
            calendar).
            The project proposal is a 2-page description of what you intend to do (experiments, datasets,
            methods, etc.)
            All documents should follow <a
                    href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2022/kxymzbjpwsqx">template</a>.
            The instructor(s) will provide feedback on these ideas to help the teams with finding a
            concrete idea. Here is examples of project proposals from previous years:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="files/proposal-2_seek-extracted_171762894.pdf">Ensemble Domain-Specific Knowledge
                    Distillation </a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Midway progress reports:</b> Reports discussing the
            progress made thus far (at most 5 pages; this <a
                    href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2022/kxymzbjpwsqx">template</a>.) and
            elaborates on the remaining work.
            Describe the progress made, experiments you have run, preliminary results you have obtained, how you plan to
            spend the rest of your time, etc.
            While this is called "midway" in practice it should be considered more than halfway! By this milestone,
            you’re expected to have implemented some system, and to have some experimental results to show by this date.
        </li>
        <li><b>Final poster presentations:</b>
            <!--            The final project presentation will be during the final exam period. All students-->
            <!--            in each group are required to present some material during the final presentation.-->
            All students will present their findings at a poster presentation during the final exam period.
        </li>
        <li><b>Final report:</b> Students should write code and carry out additional experiments and then write up the
            results in a standard conference paper format (at most 8 pages; use this <a
                    href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2022/kxymzbjpwsqx">template</a>).
            References don't count toward the page limit. Note
            that longer reports are not necessarily better.
            Students in groups are required to include a “contributions” section concretely lists each
            author’s contributions (see Section 8 of this paper, for example).
            The final report should concisely summarize your findings and answer the following questions:
            1. What approach did you take to address this problem, and why?
            2. How did you explore the space of solutions?
            3. How did you evaluate the performance of the approach(es) you investigated?
            4. What worked, what did not work, and why?
            <br>
            Here are examples of final reports from the previous year:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="files/final-seek.pdf">Ensemble Domain-Specific Knowledge Distillation </a></li>

                    via Self-Teaching</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Project grading:</b>
            The goal of the project is to demonstrate the group’s understanding of the tools
            and challenges when using self-supervised models.
            Grading will reflect the quality of
            the approach, the rigor of evaluation, and reasoning about successes and failures.
            Grading will also depend on the completeness of the project, the clarity of the writeup,
            the level of complexity/difficulty of the approach, and your ability to justify the choices you made.

            Here is the grade breakdown for the projects:

        <li><b>Collaboration:</b> Study groups are allowed, but students must understand and complete their own
            assignments, and hand in one assignment per student. If you worked in a group, please put the names of the
            members of your study group at the top of your assignment. Please ask if you have any questions about the
            collaboration policy.
            Again, you must understand and complete your own assignments in your own words, and hand in one assignment
            per student.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Using Other Resources:</b>
            We strongly encourage you to use any outside source at your disposal, provided you use your sources properly
            and give them proper credit. If you get an idea from an outside source, citing that source will not lower
            your grade. Failing to properly cite an outside source—thereby taking credit for ideas that are not your
            own—is plagiarism.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Appropriate Citations:</b>
            You must write everything in your own words, and properly cite every outside source you use, including other
            students. Using ideas from other sources or people without citation is plagiarism. Copying other sources
            verbatim,
            even with proper citation, is plagiarism. Don't do that.
            The only sources that you are not required to cite are the official course materials (lectures, slides, and
            assignments).
        </li>
        <!--        <li><b>Late start:</b>If the result gives you a higher grade, we will not use your assignment 1 score, and we will give you an assignment grade based on counting each of assignments 2–5 at 13.5%.</li>-->
        <li><b>Honor code:</b>
            We expect students to not look at solutions or implementations online. We take the student Honor Code
            seriously.
            We sometimes use automated methods to detect overly similar assignment solutions.

    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
        The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. In this course,
        you must be honest and truthful, abiding by the Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy:
    </p>


    <div class="container sec" id="cs-conduct">
        <i>
            <p>
                Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic
                integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The university will
                punish cheaters with failure on an assignment, failure in a course, permanent
                transcript notation, suspension, and/or expulsion. Offenses may be reported to
                medical, law or other professional or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
                Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments without
                permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized
                collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying,
                facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition. Ignorance of these rules
                is not an excuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except where
                the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and programming
                assignments without the help of others. For example, you must not look at anyone
                else’s solutions (including program code) to your homework problems. However,
                you may discuss assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure
                you understand what is required by the assignment.
                If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside sources, such
                as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly cite the source. Not citing
                it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your group projects must list everyone who
                participated.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above paragraph "outside sources" also include content that was produced by an AI assistant
                like ChatGPT.
                This follows either by treating the AI assistant as a person for the purposes of this policy
                (controversial) or acknowledging that the AI assistant was trained directly on people's original work.
                Thus, while you are not forbidden from using these tools, you should consider the above policy
                carefully and quote where appropriate. Assignments that are in large part quoted from an AI
                assistant are very unlikely to be evaluated positively. In addition, if a student's work is
                substantially identical to another student's work, that will be grounds for an investigation
                of plagiarism regardless of whether the prose was produced by an AI assistant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
                Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular assignments. To
                protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not sure what is permissible. (2)
                Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs, as you are always encouraged to do,
                rather than from other students. (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may
                have received.
