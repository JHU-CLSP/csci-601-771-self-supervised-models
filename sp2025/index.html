<!-- Intro -->
<div class="container sec" id="intro">
    <p>
        Self-supervised learning (pre-training) has led to the development of artifacts like Large Language Models
        (LLMs), which have revolutionized fields such as natural language processing (NLP). This course serves as an
        introduction to self-supervised learning within the context of natural language. Its objective is to provide a
        comprehensive overview of industry standards for pre-training, aligning, and deploying language models. The
        course is designed to equip you with a diverse set of skills essential for future success, whether you aim to
        conduct research using language models or apply them in industrial settings. PyTorch will be the primary
        programming language used in the class. The course will include instructor-led lectures, seven assignments
        involving both empirical and theoretical work, in-class quizzes, and a final project.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Note:</b> The course is different from <a href="https://self-supervised.cs.jhu.edu/fa2024/">601.771</a>
        (typically offered in fall semesters) which is focused on advanced topics in recent papers and is geared toward
        grad
        students that
        want to specialize in the latest developments in self-supervised models.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Prerequisites</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li>Background in algorithms: "Data Structures" (601.226)
        </li>
        <li>All the class assignments will be in Python/PyTorch. If you don’t know Python or PyTorch but have experience
            in other programming languages (Java, C++, etc.) you can probably pick Python/PyTorch pretty quickly.
        </li>
        <li>Calculus and linear algebra: you should be comfortable with matrix operations (matrix multiplication,
            transpose, inverse, dot product, gradients).
        </li>
        <li>Probability: basic probability properties (conditionals, marginals, mean, standard deviation), distributions
            (normal, categorical, etc.).
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suggestive prerequisites</strong>:
        Not a hard prerequisites but it is highly useful to have background in "Natural Language Processing" and
        "Machine
        Learning". You may gain such background by taking the following courses: "Machine Learning" (CS 475/675), OR
        "Machine Learning: Deep Learning" (CS 482/682), OR "Natural Language
        Processing"
        (CS 465/665), OR "Machine Translation" (CS 468/668).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Relevant Courses at Hopkins</strong>:
        This course has some overlap with "Natural Language Processing" (EN.601/665), and "Artificial Agents"
        (EN.601.470/670), though the courses have different focuses.

    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p>
        The homework offers you a chance to practice applying what you've learned. It is intended to complement lectures
        and office hours, which aim to provide intuition, motivation, and justification for the skills we want you to
        develop. However, the most effective way to build these skills is by attempting to solve the problems on your
        own. The process of practicing is far more valuable than simply being provided with the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        The course includes 7 weekly assignments leading up to spring break, designed to enhance both your
        theoretical knowledge and practical abilities. Each assignment consists of written questions and programming
        components (Python). Assignments will be posted on this website, and submissions should be uploaded
        to Gradescope.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Submission:</b> Assignments must be submitted via GradeScope. If you're not familiar with Gradescope,
            check out <a href="https://help.gradescope.com/category/cyk4ij2dwi-student-workflow">its documentation</a>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Collaboration:</b> Study groups are permitted, but each student must individually understand and <b>complete
            their own assignments in your own words</b> (not sharing answers), submitting one assignment per person.
            Remember, you must comprehend and complete your assignments
            independently, <b>using your own words</b>, and submit one assignment per student.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Using other Resources:</b>
            We highly recommend utilizing any external resources available to you, as long as you properly acknowledge
            and credit these sources. Citing an external source when you derive an idea from it will not negatively
            impact your grade. However, neglecting to properly cite an external source and thereby claiming credit for
            ideas that are not your own constitutes plagiarism.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Appropriate citations:</b>
            You must write everything in your own words, and properly cite every outside source you use, including other
            students. Using ideas from other sources or people without citation is plagiarism. Copying other sources
            verbatim,
            even with proper citation, is plagiarism. Don't do that.
            The only sources that you are not required to cite are the official course materials (lectures, slides, and
            assignments).
        </li>
        <li><b>Honor code:</b>
            We expect students to not look at solutions or implementations online. We take the student Honor Code
            seriously.
            We sometimes use automated methods to detect overly similar assignment solutions.
        </li>
        <li><b>Late days:</b>
            Got sick? Have a conference to attend? Use your "late days"!
            Each student has 7 late days to use for assignments.
            A late day extends the deadline 24 hours.
            Once you have used all your late days, the penalty is 5% off the final homework grade for each additional
            late day.
            For example, if you're late for 3 days on an assignment (beyond your legitimate "late days" capacity, which
            is 7 days per homework and 10 days in total), you will lose 15% of the points for that assignment.
            The deadline cutoffs are at 9am each day. There are no fractional late days. If you're late for 1 hour,
            you lose a full day.
        </li>
        <li><b>Max delay per assignment:</b>
            You can use up to 7 late days per assignment (so, if you're late on HW1, you can submit it until the release
            of HW2).
            Assignments submitted after 7 late days will not be graded (unless explicit permission is given in advance
            by the instructor).
        </li>
        <li><b>Grading:</b>
            Homeworks are graded by the entire course staff directly on Gradescope. To keep grading consistent,
            each numbered problem is graded by a single grader, under the supervision of one of the TAs, using a
            detailed
            rubric on Gradescope. Under normal circumstances, all homework should be graded within 10
            calendar days of submission.
        </li>
        <li><b>Regrading:</b>
            Regrade requests can be submitted directly within Gradescope and must include a brief written justification
            for the request.
            We encourage students who have questions or concerns about their grades to talk with the course staff before
            submitting a regrade request.
            However, no grades will be changed in any student's presence.

    <h2>In-class Quizzes</h2>
    <p>
        There will be 3 in-class quizes. The midterm exams will be paper-based and during the usual class time.
        The exams will assess students' mastery of the topics discussed in the lectures and homework assignments.
        The exams also provide feedback to both the student and the instructor, and identify areas that need
        improvement to inform further learning and teaching.
        The quizzes will encompass all material from the start of the semester up to the topic specified by the

        <li><b>Group work:</b> Students are strongly encouraged to work in groups on the final project (team sizes
            limited to a maximum of 4 people).
        </li>
        <li><b>Project proposals:</b> All groups will be required to submit a project proposal (due on the class
            calendar).
            The project proposal is a 2-page description of what you intend to do (experiments, datasets,
            methods, etc.)
            All documents (proposal, midway report and final report) should use this <a
                    href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2024/tpsbbrdqcmsh">template</a>.
            The instructor(s) will provide feedback on these ideas to help the teams with finding a
            concrete idea. Here is examples of project proposals from previous years:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="files/prompting_unlearned_LLM_proopsal.pdf">Adversarial Prompting of Unlearned Language
                    Models</a></li>
                <li><a href="files/proposal-2_seek-extracted_171762894.pdf">Ensemble Domain-Specific Knowledge
                    Distillation </a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Midway progress reports:</b> Reports discussing the
            progress made thus far (at most 5 pages; use the same suggested template for the proposals) and
            elaborates on the remaining work.
            Describe the progress made, experiments you have run, preliminary results you have obtained, how you plan to
            spend the rest of your time, etc.
            While this is called "midway" in practice it should be considered more than halfway! By this milestone,
            you’re expected to have implemented something, and to have some experimental results to show by this date.
        </li>
        <li><b>Final poster presentations:</b>
            All students will present their findings at a poster presentation during the final exam period.
        </li>
        <li><b>Final report:</b> Students should write code and carry out additional experiments and then write up the
            results in a standard conference paper format (at most 8 pages; use the same template we had suggested for
            the proposals).
            References don't count toward the page limit. Note
            that longer reports are not necessarily better.
            Students in groups are required to include a “contributions” section concretely lists each
            author’s contributions (see Section 8 of this paper, for example).
            The final report should concisely summarize your findings and answer the following questions:
            1. What approach did you take to address this problem, and why?
            2. How did you explore the space of solutions?
            3. How did you evaluate the performance of the approach(es) you investigated?
            4. What worked, what did not work, and why?
            <br>
            Here are examples of final reports from the previous year:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="files/prompting_unlearned_LLM_Final_Project.pdf">Adversarial Prompting of Unlearned
                    Language Models</a></li>
                <li><a href="files/final-seek.pdf">Ensemble Domain-Specific Knowledge Distillation </a></li>
                <li><a href="files/final-efficient_distillation_671_May_14.pdf">Efficient Distillation of Transformers
                    via Self-Teaching</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Project grading:</b>
            The goal of the project is to demonstrate the group’s understanding of the tools
            and challenges when using self-supervised models.
            Grading will reflect the quality of
            the approach, the rigor of evaluation, and reasoning about successes and failures.
            Grading will also depend on the completeness of the project, the clarity of the writeup,
            the level of complexity/difficulty of the approach, and your ability to justify the choices you made.

            Here is the grade breakdown for the projects:

            <ul>
                <li>Project proposal: 20%</li>

    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
        The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. In this course,
        you must be honest and truthful, abiding by the Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy:

            <p>
                Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic
                integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The university will
                punish cheaters with failure on an assignment, failure in a course, permanent
                transcript notation, suspension, and/or expulsion. Offenses may be reported to
                medical, law or other professional or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
                Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments without
                permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized
                collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying,
                facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition. Ignorance of these rules
                is not an excuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except where
                the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and programming
                assignments without the help of others. For example, you must not look at anyone
                else’s solutions (including program code) to your homework problems. However,
                you may discuss assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure
                you understand what is required by the assignment.
                If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside sources, such
                as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly cite the source. Not citing
                it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your group projects must list everyone who
                participated.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above paragraph "outside sources" also include content that was produced by an AI assistant
                like ChatGPT.
                This follows either by treating the AI assistant as a person for the purposes of this policy
                (controversial) or acknowledging that the AI assistant was trained directly on people's original work.
                Thus, while you are not forbidden from using these tools, you should consider the above policy
                carefully and quote where appropriate. Assignments that are in large part quoted from an AI
                assistant are very unlikely to be evaluated positively. In addition, if a student's work is
                substantially identical to another student's work, that will be grounds for an investigation
                of plagiarism regardless of whether the prose was produced by an AI assistant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
                Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular assignments. To
                protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not sure what is permissible. (2)
                Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs, as you are always encouraged to do,
                rather than from other students. (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may
                have received.
